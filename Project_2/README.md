This project contains a dataset of fast-food chain from an imaginary restaurant company. 
The objective is to investigate statistically data from a fastfood chain company; therefore, we perform statistics and machine learning to dig deep to gain information. 
The methods we use are the hypothesis of two independent populations, analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation matrix,
multi-class logistic regression, and k nearest neighbor (KNN). 
All codes that we wrote are free to copy if you need them (but please do not delete the name's creator).
